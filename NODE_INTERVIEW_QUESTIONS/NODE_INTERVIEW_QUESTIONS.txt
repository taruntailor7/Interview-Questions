Q.1  Explain in brief what is node js?
Sol: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. 
     It is used to create server-side web applications.
     Features of NodeJS: 
     i) It’s easy to get started.
     ii) It provides fast and highly scalable services.
     iii) It uses JavaScript everywhere, so it’s easy for a JavaScript programmer to build back-end services using Node.js
     iv) Source code cleaner and consistent.
     v) Large ecosystem for open source library.
     vi) It has Asynchronous or Non-blocking nature.

Q.2  How is node js non-blocking?
sol: Node.js is based on an event-driven non-blocking I/O model. It refers to the program that does not block the execution of further operations. 
     Non-Blocking methods are executed asynchronously. 
     Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line. The program calls the function and move to the next operation 
     and does not wait for it to return.

Q.3  What is throughput?
Sol: Throughput tells you how much data was transferred from a source at any given time.
