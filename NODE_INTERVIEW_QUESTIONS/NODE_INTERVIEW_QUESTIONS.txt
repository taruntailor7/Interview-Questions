Q.1  Explain in brief what is node js?
Sol: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the clientâ€™s browser. 
     It is used to create server-side web applications.
     Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. 
     You can use  I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, 
     Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.

Q.2  How is node js non-blocking?
sol: Non-Blocking nature of node. js simply means that node. js proceeds with the execution of the program instead of waiting for long I/O 
     operations or HTTP requests. i.e the non-JavaScript related code is processed in the background by different threads or by the browser 
     which gets executed when node.
