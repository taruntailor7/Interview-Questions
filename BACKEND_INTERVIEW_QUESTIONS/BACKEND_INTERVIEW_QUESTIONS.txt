Q.1 What is Caching? How can you save money with Caching?
Sol: A cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, 
    so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data’s primary 
    storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.

    By serving web pages to your users from a local web cache, you need to fetch less data from the internet, 
    saving you bandwidth and money. Bandwidth savings translate into money in different ways in different organisations:
    i) No need to upgrade to a higher bandwidth connection
    ii) Direct cost savings on metered connections: less data traffic = lower bills
    iii) Ability to add more users without increasing capacity.

Q.2 What is load balancing?
Sol: Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application. 
    Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data 
    to each user in a fast and reliable manner. To handle such high volumes of traffic, most applications have many resource servers 
    with duplicate data between them. A load balancer is a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an 
    invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.

    Benefits of load balancing:
    i) Application availability
    ii) Application scalability
    iii) Application security
    iv) Application performance

Q.3 What is CAP Theorem?
Sol: The CAP theorem (also called Brewer’s theorem) states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these 
    three characteristics: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
    i) Consistency: A system is said to be consistent if all nodes see the same data at the same time.
    ii) Availability: Availability in a distributed system ensures that the system remains operational 100% of the time. Every request 
        gets a (non-error) response regardless of the individual state of a node.
    iii) Partition Tolerance: This condition states that the system does not fail, regardless of if messages are dropped or delayed 
        between nodes in a system.

Q.4 What is PACELC Theorem?
Sol: The PACELC theorem states that in a system that replicates data:
    i) if there is a partition (P), a distributed system can tradeoff between availability and consistency (A or C)
    ii) else (E), when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, the system can tradeoff between latency (L) and consistency (C).

    The first part of the theorem (PAC) is the same as the CAP theorem, and the ELC is the extension. The whole thesis assumes we 
    maintain high availability by replication. So, when there is a failure, CAP theorem prevails. But if not, we still have to consider 
    the tradeoff between consistency and latency of a replicated system.

Q.5 What is Eventual Consistency?
Sol: Eventual Consistency is a guarantee that when an update is made in a distributed database, that update will eventually be reflected in all nodes 
    that store the data, resulting in the same response every time the data is queried. With eventual consistency, results are less consistent early on, 
    but they are provided much faster with low latency. Early results of eventual consistency data queries may not have the most recent updates because 
    it takes time for updates to reach replicas across a database cluster.

Q.6 What is Strong Consistency?
Sol: Strong Consistency simply means the data must be strongly consistent at all times. All the server nodes across the world should contain the same 
    value as an entity at any point in time. And the only way to implement this behavior is by locking down the nodes when being updated. 

Q.7 What are the different types of databases?
Sol: i) Hierarchical databases: his database follows the progression of data being categorized in ranks or levels, wherein data is categorized based 
            on a common point of linkage.
    ii) Network databases:  The child records are given the freedom to associate with multiple parent records. As a result, a network or net of 
            database files linked with multiple threads is observed. 
    iii) Object-oriented databases: . Information stored in a database is capable of being represented as an object which response as an instance 
            of the database model. Therefore, the object can be referenced and called without any difficulty. 
    iv) Relational databases: In this database, every piece of information has a relationship with every other piece of information. 
            This is on account of every data value in the database having a unique identity in the form of a record.
    v) NoSQL databases: A NoSQL database includes simplicity of design, simpler horizontal scaling to clusters of machines, and finer control over 
            availability. MongoDB falls in the category of NoSQL document-based database.
