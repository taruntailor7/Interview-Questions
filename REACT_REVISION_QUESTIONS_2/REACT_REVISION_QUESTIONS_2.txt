Q.1  Explain redux to a 5 year old (ELI5) ?
Ans: Consider someone who has given you a task to get some chocolate out of a shopkeeper. The intention ( action ) you have in your mind is to get chocolate from the shop. In JavaScript, we can represent it as get_chocolate.
    The first step when you enter the shop is to talk to a shopkeeper and ask them to get the chocolate out of the safe. You never just go to a shop and just went straight to the store, get your chocolate, and left. 
    Redux Store ( Grocery Store ) - chocolate is kept safely in the store. The store holds the state and keeps it safe.

    Redux Actions - in the real world can be defined as a process of doing something. So in order to update anything in your state, we need to act on something. In our shop example, we need to act by talking to a shopkeeper and ask them to give you chocolate.
    The action object always has a type field that describes the action you want to perform. In our case, it is get_chocolate.

    Reducer ( Shopkeeper ) - there is no possible way of getting chocolate directly from the grocery store and we have to talk to the shopkeeper to get our chocolate. In our case, the shopkeeper is the reducer. It will go to the store and get the chocolate. The whole process is called dispatching an action.
    Reducer ( Shopkeeper ) has the knowledge of how to update the state ( get the chocolate ) and ensure states get updated ( you get the chocolate ). Reducers will always return to the new state.

    This was the whole process of geeting chocolate ( performing action ) by asking from shopkeeper ( using reducer to dispatch ) and geetting chocolate from grocery store ( Redux store ).

Q.2 How is redux different from context API?
Sol:
    _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    |            Context API                                 |   Redux                                                         |
    |                                                        |                                                                 |
    | i) useContext is a hook.                               |   Redux is a state management library.                          |
    | ii) It is used to share data.                          |   It is used to manage data and state.                          |
    | iii) Changes are made with the Context value.          |   Changes are made with pure functions i.e. reducers.           |
    | iv) We can change the state in it.                     |   The state is read-only. We cannot change them directly.       |
    | v) It re-renders all components whenever there         |   It only re-render the updated components.                     | 
    |    is any update in the provider’s value prop.         |                                                                 |
    |vi) It is better to use with small applications.        |   It is perfect for larger applications.                        |
    |vii) It is easy to understand and requires less code.   |   It is quite complex to understand.                            |

Q.3 What does useSelector do?
Sol: useSelector() ​ Allows you to extract data from the Redux store state, using a selector function.

Q.4 What is immutability?
Sol: In functional and in object-oriented programming, an object is considered as immutable when its state can’t be changed after it was created. 
    Benefits of immutable objects - they can be helpful in multi-threaded applications where multiple threads can use data represented by immutable objects without concern of the data 
    being changed by other threads.

Q5. Why do we need to spread the state in redux?
Sol: Spread operator could be use to simplify passing react props down to a component. In react redux and reducer functions, spread operator are applied to compute new state without mutating state.
    Like the Array Spread Operator, the Object Spread Operator creates a shallow clone of the original object. 

Q.6 What does Object.freeze() do?
Sol: The Object.freeze() method freezes an object. Freezing an object prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-writable and non-configurable. A frozen object can no longer 
    be changed: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability, configurability, writability, or value cannot be changed, and the object's 
    prototype cannot be re-assigned. freeze() returns the same object that was passed in.
    EXAMPLE:- 
    const obj = {
        prop: 42
    };

    Object.freeze(obj);

    obj.prop = 33;
    // Throws an error in strict mode

    console.log(obj.prop);
    // expected output: 42
