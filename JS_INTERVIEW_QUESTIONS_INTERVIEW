Q.1 Give an example where call apply bind is. required?
Ans Traditionally in JavaScript, you can have objects that have their own properties and methods. For example, object1 cannot use the methods of object2 and vice versa.

    But there’s a way to overcome this restriction.
    You can use call(), apply(), and bind() methods to tie a function into an object and call the function as if it belonged to that object.

    Eg: Let’s go through these three methods one by one and see some use-cases as well.

        Call() Method in JavaScript
        The call() method invokes a function with a specified context. In other words, you can tie a function into an object as if it belonged to the object.

        Example
        Let’s create an object obj and a function add() for adding up a number with another:

        var obj = { num: 2 };
        function add(a){
        return this.num + a;
        }
        Now, there’s a problem with add(). It’s trying to return this.num + some value. But there is no property num inside the function. Thus calling this.num fails.

        But as you can see, the object obj has a property num. What if you could call the function add() on that object as if it belonged to the object?

        This is indeed possible. To do this, use the call() method to tie the function add() momentarily to the object obj:

        add.call(obj, 3);

    Apply() Method in JavaScript
    The apply() method does the exact same as call(). The difference is that call() accepts an argument list, but apply() accepts an array of arguments.

    For example:


    Output:

    10
    

    Bind() Method in JavaScript
    You previously learned what call() and apply() methods do. As you saw, they executed the function immediately when called (and returned a value).

    The bind() method is reminiscent of call() and apply(). But instead of executing a function immediately, bind() returns a function that can be executed later on.

    Let’s modify the previous example to use bind():


    So calling add.bind(obj, 3, 5) returns a function. In this case, you assign it to a constant called func and then run it.

    Calling func() here means calling add() function on the object obj with the arguments of 3, 5.

    Now you understand what call(), apply(), and bind() are and how they work. Here’s a summary of how you can use each with the same object-function setup you saw earlier.

    Output:

    10 10 10

Q.2 What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?
Ans readFileSync() method is an inbuilt application programming interface of fs module which is used to read the file and return its content. In fs. readFile() method, we can read a file in a non-blocking asynchronous way, but in fs. readFileSync() method, we can read files in a synchronous way, i.e. we are telling node.
