Q.1 What are SQL Databases? What are some companies that use Mongo, what type of applications are these?
Sol: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's used for relational databases. A SQL database is a collection of tables that stores a 
    specific set of structured data.
    
    Currently, more than 31,000 companies are using MongoDB to build scalable applications and accelerate digital innovation. Leading companies
    like Forbes, Toyota, Flobiz, Marcello, and others are MongoDB customers.

    MongoDB performs brilliantly in applications that require data to be unstructured. For instance, various MapReduce Applications, Big-Data 
    systems,Social Networking applications, News Forums, etc. In such use-cases, it is difficult to structure data across tables.

Q.2 What are NoSQL Databases?
Sol:NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come 
    in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.

Q.3 What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
Sol:                     SQL	                                        |                    NoSQL
    RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)	                |   Non-relational or distributed database system.
    These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema	    |   They have dynamic schema
    These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.   |	These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.
    These databases are best suited for complex queries.            |   These databases are not so good for complex queries
    Vertically Scalable	                                            |   Horizontally scalable
    Follows ACID property	                                        |   Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
    Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, etc	        |   Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra, etc

Q.4 What are some features of MongoDB?
Sol: Features of MongoDB â€“
    i) Schema-less Database
    ii) Document Oriented
    iii) Indexing
    iv) Scalability
    v) Replication
    vi) Aggregation
    vii) High Performance

Q.5 What are aggregate queries?
Sol: For doing huge computations, in MongoDB, we use aggregation. Aggregation groups the data from multiple documents and provides the summed 
    up results, the average value from a large result set, min/max value from a large result set, etc. In this article, let us see how we can 
    perform Aggregation using Mongoose.

Q.6 What are pipelines in aggregation?
Sol: An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents: Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. 
    For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values. The documents that are output from a stage are passed 
    to the next stage.

Q.7 How do you do aggregate queries?
Sol: Common Aggregate Queries:- 
    i) Compute the average value from a numeric sequence
    ii) Count the number of elements in a sequence
    iii) Count the number of records (entries) in a column or table
    iv) Find the maximum value in a numeric sequence
    v) Find the minimum value in a numeric sequence
    vi) Compute the sum of values in a numeric sequence
    vii) Compute the standard deviation of a numeric sequence.

Q.8 How can you group by a particular value in MongoDB?
Sol: The $group operator is an aggregation operator or an aggregation stage, which groups multiple data or documents by some specified expression 
    and combines them into a single document. 
    Syntax: $group operator 
    {
        $group:
        {
            _id: <expression>,
            <field>: { <accumulator> : <expression> }
        }
    }
    _id: It is the field by which you want to group the documents.
    field: It is an optional parameter, and it is the computed field after performing certain accumulator operations on the grouped data.

Q.9 How can you paginate on MongoDB?
Sol: The most important use of paging implementation is it used the skip, limit, and sort in database level.
    1) MongoDB pagination by using limit method
        db.collection_name.find () .limit (number);
    2) MongoDB pagination by using skip method
        db.collection_name.find () .skip (number);
